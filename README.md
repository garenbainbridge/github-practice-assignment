# This repository named github-practice-assignment acts as the Week 2 Assignment for BIOS 4801.

Description: Some goals I have for this class are learning more about analyzing biological data sets, so I can get a better understanding of data analysis for parasitological studies. I am also hoping to gain a proficiency in R, Github, and any other software we plan on using in this class.

My most important reasons for reproducibility are to ensure that the data and methods of a specific study are accurate to what the original researchers claim. Another reason that is important to me is to ensure that medical innovations perform the actual intended action so that patients can benefit as much as possible from novel discoveries.
